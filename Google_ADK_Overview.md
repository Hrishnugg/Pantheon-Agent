# Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) Overview

The Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) is an open-source framework aimed at simplifying the creation and deployment of AI agents. It's designed to be flexible, supporting different models and deployment environments.

## Key Features:

*   **Flexible Orchestration:** Supports various workflow patterns (sequential, parallel, loops) and uses Large Language Models (LLMs) for dynamic routing and adaptive behavior.
*   **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Allows combining multiple specialized agents in a hierarchy for complex tasks.
*   **Rich Tool Ecosystem:** Includes pre-built tools (e.g., Search, Code Execution) and allows integration of custom functions and third-party libraries (like LangChain, CrewAI). Agents can also use other agents as tools.
*   **Deployment Flexibility:** Agents can be containerized and deployed in various environments, including locally, on Vertex AI Agent Engine, or custom infrastructures like Cloud Run or Docker.
*   **Built-in Evaluation:** Provides tools to assess agent performance, looking at both response quality and how the agent executed the task.
*   **Safety and Security:** Offers guidelines for building secure agents.

## Core Components:

*   **Agents:** The decision-making entities.
*   **Tools:** Functions or capabilities used by agents.
*   **Runners:** Manage the execution flow and state.
*   **Sessions:** Maintain conversation context.
*   **Events:** Used for communication between components.

## Architectural Patterns:

*   **Modular Design:** Components can be easily combined and reconfigured.
*   **Extensibility:** New tools and models can be added.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** Clear distinctions between reasoning, capabilities, execution, and state management.

## Getting Started:

1.  **Installation:** `pip install google-adk`
