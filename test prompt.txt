I have a 1550 SAT, 35 ACT, a 4.2 weighted GPA (3.75 unweighted), 10 APs taken, Top 200 on the National Math Olympiad, Varsity Tennis Captain, and have founded the AI Club at my school. I have also built an app called FridgeFit that allows people to gather recipes just based on a picture of the ingredients in their fridge. What are my chances of admission into Caltech, Stanford, and UC Berkeley?
